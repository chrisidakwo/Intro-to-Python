Create a folder called "classes" and place these files inside the folder:
- __init__.py
- composition.py
- inheritance.py
- polymorphism.py
- staticmethods.py
- using_property_decorators.py
- working_with_classes.py

Please ensure the folder has an __init__.py file. So that Python can mark
the folder as one a module root.

Doing this will help you sort out the issues with relative import.

Working with Pycharm? Mark the "classes" folder as "Sources Root"
